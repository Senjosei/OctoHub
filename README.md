**This fork aim to attempt the revival of the awesome FastHub-RE application. The code base is based on a set of changes done on the original [FastHub repository](https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub) by [thermatk](https://github.com/thermatk/FastHub-Libre) and [LightDestory](https://github.com/LightDestory/FastHub-RE)**. We can sum up these changes with:

- **Porting to Kotlin and Gradle upgrade, all thanks to [zeromake](https://github.com/zeromake/FastHub), he is doing a god-like work!**
- Cleaned from blobs (Removed firebase dependencies and analytic stuff);
- Notifications works using native JobScheduler without any push messaging involved, although the minimum supported update interval becomes 20 minutes;
- It's possible to unlock premium features, if needed, in a manner which nudges to still try to find a way and support upstream developers. **Once again, please find a way to financially support upstream developers**.


The reasons behind the initial changes by thermatk are:

- **Technical reasons**
  - Upstream developers will never be able to comply with the [F-Droid's inclusion policy](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_Policy/?title=Inclusion_Policy)
- **Ideological reasons**
  - Upstream developers get offended by the high standards of the F-Droid community, which inevitably result in an _Anti-Feature: Non-Free Network_ badge for any Github client
  - Upstream developers don't adequately account for users of Android devices without GMS
  - Upstream app has some _PRO_-features. Users without GMS have no way to unlock these features, turning the software into unfixable crippleware
  - Upstream developers have shown in the past that they lack a general understanding of the GPL
  - Upstream developers strongly disapprove that in this fork one can access the _PRO_ features without paying
    - This fork will have to carry on without approval until a better solution will surface
    - The unlocking page and the way to this page is made respective and nudging to go and support


Moreover, a set of fixes has been cherry picked from [KaustubhPatange](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/FastHub) and [figonzal1](https://github.com/figonzal1/FastHub-RE/) forks.

__My project, OctoHub, tries to continue the awesome job of the original and currently unmaintained FastHub and the good intentions of FastHub-Libre and FastHub-RE.__

## Description
Yet another **open-source** GitHub client app based on FastHub looking forward for newer features.

:warning:**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I am not a professional/senior Android developer. I started my adventure on Android development not so long ago so I am new here, _I am not able to work with this code easily yet, but I will try my best_. This code is not helping me neither, it is generally a mess: most of the stuff is deprecated or so sticked together that if you mess something it will be a pain to stacktrace the error :cry:

**Any help and contribution is very appreciated!**

## :gear: Building

Thanks  to [zeromake](https://github.com/zeromake/FastHub) we are now able to compile the project using the latest Android Studio available!

We don't need anymore Android Studio 4.1 and Gradle 3.5! Hallelujah!

To build a debug version you can just import the project and start the building process. All the needed IDs (for debugging purpose) are hard-coded inside the `build.gradle.kts` meanwhile the debug keys are located in `/app/keys_debug.jks`.

To build your own release application you need to create a `secrets.properties` inside `/app/` with your custom credentials:

- **PASSWORD**=`here`
- **KEY_ALIAS**=`here`
- **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID**=`here`
- **GITHUB_SECRET**=`here`
- **IMGUR_CLIENT_ID**=`here`
- **IMGUR_SECRET**=`here`

Then, create your own keystore and put it in `/app/keys_release.jks`.

## :book: Spec / Open-Source libraries:

- Minimum **SDK 25**
- [**Kotlin**](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin)
- **MVP**-architecture: [**ThirtyInch**](https://github.com/grandcentrix/ThirtyInch) because its ThirtyInch.
- [**RxJava2**](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) & [**RxAndroid**](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) for Retrofit & background threads
- [**Retrofit**](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for constructing the REST API
- [**Requery**](https://github.com/requery/requery/) for offline-mode
- [**Stream API**](https://github.com/aNNiMON/Lightweight-Stream-API) for dealing with `Collections`
- [**Android State**](https://github.com/evernote/android-state) for saving instance states
- [**Material-BottomNavigation**](https://github.com/sephiroth74/Material-BottomNavigation) for `BottomBar` tabs
- [**FastHub Contribution View**](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/fasthub-contribution-view) for the contribution listing
- [**Glide**](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for loading images

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I see my <b>Organizations</b> either <i>Private</i> or <i>Public</i> ones?</summary>
  <p>Open up https://github.com/settings/applications and look for FastHub, open it then scroll to Organization access and click on Grant Button,
  alternatively login via <b>Access Token</b> which will ease this setup.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I tried to login via Access Token & OTP but why isn't it working?</summary>
  <p>You can't login via Access Token & OTP all together due to the lifetime of the OTP code, you'll be required to login in every few seconds.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are my Private Repo and Enterprise Wiki not showing up?</summary>
  <p>It's due to FastHub scraping GitHub Wiki page & Private Repos require session token that FastHub doesn't have.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I login with Enterprise account but can't interact with anything other than my Enterprise GitHub.</summary>
  <p>Well, logically, you can't access anything else other than your Enterprise, but FastHub made that possible but can't do much about it, in most cases since your login credential doesn't exists in GitHub server. But in <b>few</b> cases your GitHub account Oauth token will do the trick.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why am I having problems editing Issues/PRs?</summary>
  <p>If you are unable to edit an issue in a public organization, please contact your Organization Admin to grant access to FastHub. Alternatively you can login using an Access Token with the correct permissions granted.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I'm having this issue! / I want this and that!</summary>
  <p>Head to https://github.com/HardcodedCat/FastHub-RE/issues/new and create new issue for bugs or feature requests. I really encourage you to search before opening a ticket. Any duplicate request will result in it being closed immediately.</p>
